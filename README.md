# React Todo List - The Matrix

Overview

This project is a simple todo list application developed using HTML, CSS, and React. The styling is inspired by "The Matrix" with a matrix-like design. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, which moves them from "Blue Pill (Incomplete)" into a sub-category labeled "Red Pill (Completed)". Additionally, tasks can be deleted. The application persists data to local storage, ensuring that the tasks remain even after refreshing the page.
